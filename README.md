### Hello! Welcome.

These are my minimal dotfiles for hyprland that i run at a daily basis.
I use "GNU Stow" to manage my dotfiles. And fonts used are ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd.
- install stow
- clone repo
- cd into repo
- then if for example you want to use helix config , type command "stow helix"
  from the repo directory to have the symlinks setup for you.
- **Don't** use stow for keyd file.
  Check documentation for setting up [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd).
