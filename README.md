Hello!

These are simple dotfiles for hyprland that run at a daily basis.
I use 'Stow' to manage my dotfiles.
- install stow
- clone repo
- cd into repo
- then if for example you want to use helix config , type command "stow helix"
  to have to symlinks setup for you.
- Don't use stow for keyd file.
 check arch documentation for setting up keyd.
